# OperatingSystemsProjects

This repository contains a collection of projects that I developed while exploring Operating Systems. Each project is a unique application of OS concepts, ranging from file manipulation to memory management.

Projects Included
CopyIt: A C program (copyit.c) that demonstrates file copying at a low level. It provides insights into file I/O operations in C.

MyShell: A simple shell implementation (myshell.c) in C. This project helps understand how shells work and how they interact with the underlying operating system.

Mandelbrot Set Generator: A program (mandel.c) to generate the Mandelbrot set. It's an example of complex calculations and graphics in C.

Virtual Memory Manager: This C program (virtmem.c) simulates a virtual memory management system, offering a practical look into memory allocation and paging.
